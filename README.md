# Breast-Cancer-detection-using-Logistic-Regression


### Did you know that approximately 70% of data science problems involve classification and logistic regression is a common solution for binary problems?Logistic regression has many applications in data science, but in the world of healthcare, it can really drive life-changing action.
## Here we will find out  how to detect breast cancer by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based off its characteristics. We will be able to build a logistic regression model to identify correlations between the following 9 independent variables and the class of the tumor (benign or malignant).

### -Clump thickness

### -Uniformity of cell size

### -Uniformity of cell shape

### -Marginal adhesion

### -Single epithelial cell

### -Bare Nuclei

### -Bland chromatin

### -Normal nucleoli

### -Mitoses

## Logistic regression can identify important predictors of breast cancer using odds ratios and generate confidence intervals that provide additional information for decision-making. Model performance depends on the ability of the radiologists to accurately identify findings on mammograms.

# More about logistic regression:

## Logistic regression is a method of statistical analysis used to predict a data value based on prior observations of a dataset. A logistic regression model predicts the value of a dependent variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables. In data science, logistic regression is a Machine Learning algorithm used for classification problems and predictive analysis.
